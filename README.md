### Contents

1. **data/raw/Tickers_Codes.csv**  
   CSV File which contains all Tickers from S&P 500.

2. **scripts/Main_Stock.py**

     - Gross Profits (`grossProfits`)
     - Free Cash Flow (`freeCashflow`)
     - Company Name (`shortName`)
     - PEG Ratio (`trailingPegRatio`) 
   - Saves this data into two separate files:
     - `Stock_Info.csv` â†’ financial fundamentals.

3. **scripts/HistoricalStocks_gspread.py**
   This file reads `Tickers_Codes.csv` from Github and generates the csv file in your Google Drive.  
   Contains the **last 10 years of daily Close Price data** for all tickers in `Tickers_Codes.csv`, should be used via using Google Service account and folder in Drive with all credentials etc.[![PDF Preview](./images/H.png)]

4. **scripts/Historical_Stocks.py**
   This file reads `Tickers_Codes.csv` [saved in the Google drive of your folder] and generated a csv file containing the **last 10 years of daily Close Price data** for all tickers in `Tickers_Codes.csv`, [Can be used for manual refresh in some Google Folder, but not suitable for Github Actions as the files downloaded are >100MB].

6. **data/raw/Countries with Flags URL.csv**
   Contains Flags of all countries with URL. Used for PowerBI

7. **data/raw/Tickers Info.xlsx**

This project utilises **GitHub Actions** for automatic every day updates at 9:30 PM (IST) or 4:00 PM (UTC).  
The scheduled workflow performs the following steps:

- Checks the repository
- Configures the Python environment
- Installs dependencies (`yfinance`, `pandas`,`gspread`,`oauth2client`)
- Executes the `Main_Stocks.py` and `HistoricalStocks_gspread.py` script
- Commits and pushes the updated data to the repository or Google Drive
- Create PowerBI Dashboards etc

Note!!!: Please do not forget to create Google Service Account and Give access to the Drive. Be careful of the formats. Also Add Secerts into the drive link i.e [![PDF Preview](./images/image.png)]. When copy pasting service_key, be careful not to upload it to the drive. Convert it to base64 and then paste in Github secerts. Other drive links can we pasted as it is.
